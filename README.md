# Instructions:

The user can sign-in and login using their credentials. Upon sign-in, user will be prompted to login page. After user logs in, they will be directed to their "Therapist Home Page", which includes view of all the jobs available to the user. 

User can select a job via "view details" button and either "accept job" or "go back." 

Using the files icon, the user can go to their "My Jobs" page, which includes a list of the jobs they have "accepted."

The user can "view details" of the jobs in "My Jobs" list and either "remove" or mark as "complete" and redirect to the "my Jobs" page. (These functionalities will be part of phase 2)

User can "Logout" at anytime using the nav bar button.

# Lessons Learned
--
Deploying is challenging! This is something I would like to practice using previous projects.  Creating a back-end using MySQL was interesting and challenging in that I had to focus on using the routes to assure data would be displayed on front-end. I also learned that back-end was not as bad as I thought it would be! 

Next steps: For this web app, I would like to complete its functionality. There is a "school" user for my web app that I would love to finish to complete the whole web app. Additionally, there are libraries that I would like to implement on future phases of this web app.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
